Basic Algorithm Scripting 3: Factorialize a Number

Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.

REQUIREMENT:
factorialize(5) should return a number.
factorialize(5) should return 120.
factorialize(10) should return 3628800.
factorialize(20) should return 2432902008176640000.
factorialize(0) should return 1.


ANSWER:
function factorialize(num) {
  if (num < 0) 
    return -1;
  else if (num == 0) 
    return 1;
  else {
    return (num * factorialize(num - 1));
  }
  return num;
}

factorialize(5);
