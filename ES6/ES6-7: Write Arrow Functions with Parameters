Just like a normal function, you can pass arguments into arrow functions.

// doubles input value and returns it
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
You can pass more than one argument into arrow functions as well.


Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.

REQUIREMENT:
User did replace var keyword.
myConcat should be a constant variable (by using const).
myConcat should be a function
myConcat() returns the correct array
function keyword was not used.


ANSWER:
const myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);

// test your code
console.log(myConcat([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]));
