Recall that you use the plus sign + to look for one or more characters and the asterisk * to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets ({ and }). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

For example, to match only the letter a appearing between 3 and 5 times in the string "ah", your regex would be /a{3,5}h/.

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4); // Returns true
multipleA.test(A2); // Returns false

Change the regex ohRegex to match only 3 to 6 letter h's in the word "Oh no".

REQUIREMENT:
Your regex should use curly brackets.
Your regex should not match "Ohh no"
Your regex should match "Ohhh no"
Your regex should match "Ohhhh no"
Your regex should match "Ohhhhh no"
Your regex should match "Ohhhhhh no"
Your regex should not match "Ohhhhhhh no"



ANSWER:
let ohStr = "Ohhh no";
let ohRegex = /Oh{3,6} no/; // Change this line
let result = ohRegex.test(ohStr);
