In the last challenge, you searched for the word "Hello" using the regular expression /Hello/. That regex searched for a literal match of the string "Hello". Here's another example searching for a literal match of the string "Kevin":

let testStr = "Hello, my name is Kevin.";
let testRegex = /Kevin/;
testRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns true
Any other forms of "Kevin" will not match. For example, the regex /Kevin/ will not match "kevin" or "KEVIN".

let wrongRegex = /kevin/;
wrongRegex.test(testStr);
// Returns false
A future challenge will show how to match those other forms as well.


Complete the regex waldoRegex to find "Waldo" in the string waldoIsHiding with a literal match.

REQUIREMENT:
Your regex waldoRegex should find "Waldo"
Your regex waldoRegex should not search for anything else.
You should perform a literal string match with your regex.



ANSWER:
let waldoIsHiding = "Somewhere Waldo is hiding in this text.";
let waldoRegex = /Waldo/; // Change this line
let wrongWaldoRegex = /waldo/;
let result = waldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
let result2 = wrongWaldoRegex.test(waldoIsHiding);
