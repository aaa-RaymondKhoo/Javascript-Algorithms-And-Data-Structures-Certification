You've learned shortcuts for common string patterns like alphanumerics. Another common pattern is looking for just digits or numbers.

The shortcut to look for digit characters is \d, with a lowercase d. This is equal to the character class [0-9], which looks for a single character of any number between zero and nine.


Use the shorthand character class \d to count how many digits are in movie titles. Written out numbers ("six" instead of 6) do not count.

REQUIREMENT:
Your regex should use the shortcut character to match digit characters
Your regex should use the global flag.
Your regex should find 1 digit in "9".
Your regex should find 2 digits in "Catch 22".
Your regex should find 3 digits in "101 Dalmatians".
Your regex should find no digits in "One, Two, Three".
Your regex should find 2 digits in "21 Jump Street".
Your regex should find 4 digits in "2001: A Space Odyssey".
