Basic Date Structures 2: Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation

For example, if we want to retrieve the "a" from ourArray and assign it to a variable, we can do so with the following code:

let ourVariable = ourArray[0];
// ourVariable equals "a"
In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation:

ourArray[1] = "not b anymore";
// ourArray now equals ["a", "not b anymore", "c"];
Using bracket notation, we have now reset the item at index 1 from "b", to "not b anymore".


In order to complete this challenge, set the 2nd position (index 1) of myArray to anything you want, besides "b".

REQUIREMENT:
myArray[0] is equal to "a"
myArray[1] is no longer set to "b"
myArray[2] is equal to "c"
myArray[3] is equal to "d"


ANSWER:
let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// change code below this line
myArray[1] = "not b anymore";
//change code above this line
console.log(myArray);
